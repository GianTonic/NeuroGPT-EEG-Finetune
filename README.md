## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform fine-tuning of the NeuroGPT model on a different EEG dataset compared to the one originally used by NeuroGPT. While NeuroGPT was initially trained on motor imagery data, this project focuses on an alternative EEG dataset with the goal of adapting and optimizing the model for new applications.
